# AYTClips

I am planning on making AYTClips a user generated forum like place for users to talk about their favourite creators content, channel or anything related to a creator.

Think of it like a subreddit that's dedicated for a specific YouTuber?

I want this to be a Reddit / Lemmy / Discourse Alternative but more towards preserving YouTube Video Content ( and by using a script that downloads a clip, not the full thing as per YouTube / Google's Policies ) for the future generations to come.
